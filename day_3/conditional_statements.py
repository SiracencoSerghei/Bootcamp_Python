# ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª
#
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
#
# To work out the love score between two people:
#
#     Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
#
#     Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
#
#     Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
#
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
#
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
#
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
#
# "Your score is *z*."
#
# e.g.
#
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
#
# T occurs 0 times
#
# R occurs 1 time
#
# U occurs 2 times
#
# E occurs 2 times
#
# Total = 5
#
# L occurs 1 time
#
# O occurs 0 times
#
# V occurs 0 times
#
# E occurs 2 times
#
# Total = 3
#
# Love Score = 53
#
# Print: "Your score is 53."
# These functions will help you:
#
# lower() count()
# Example Input 1
#
# Kanye West
# Kim Kardashian
#
# Example Output 1
#
# The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
# Your score is 42, you are alright together.
#
# Example Input 2
#
# Brad Pitt
# Jennifer Aniston
#
# Example Output 2
#
# The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
# Your score is 73.
#
# Hint
#
# You can check your values against mine using this table:
# Name 1 	Name 2 	Score
# Brad Pitt 	Jennifer Aniston 	73
# Prince William 	Kate Middleton 	67
# Ashton Kutcher 	Mila Kunis 	63
